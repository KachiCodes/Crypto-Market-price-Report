Overview of the Report 

The dataset from this report includes crypto market live data that was scrapped from Cryptowatch, a popular charting & trading terminal for cryptocurrency markets. This market price data is specific to the crypto market transacations done on the Binance Exchange platform. The end goal of this project report is to analyze the market prices, trends and price actions of various cryptocurrencies for the past four years, starting from 1st January 2017 (2017-01-01) to 24th October 2022 (2022-10-24).

The dataset consists of 27,585 rows and 9 columns in total. The columns include CloseTime, OpenPrice, HighPrice, LowPrice, ClosePrice, volume, MarketCap, Symbol, and Name of each cryptocurrency listed. 

The columns : 

CloseTime: This is the specific date and time of a specific market movement of a coin. From this column, we extracted the date, year, and month columns. 

ClosePrice: The Closing price of a coin at the end of a 24-hr market time frame. 

OpenPrice: The Opening price of a coin at the end of a 24-hr market time frame. 

HighPrice: The highest price of a coin at the end of a 24-hr market time frame. 

LowPrice: The lowest price of a coin within at the end of a 24-hr market time frame. 

Volume: the number of coins traded at the end of a 24-hr market time frame. 

MarketCap: the crypto market cap is the market value of a cryptocurrency. It is gotten by multiplying the total number of mined cryptos and the prevailing market price. The crypto market is a highly volatile market so because of this prices are subject to change at any time, and as such the number of mined cryptos and market prices are prone to fluctuation, the crypto market cap also keeps fluctuating. Market Cap = supply x price.

Symbol: The symbol of each cryptocurrency. 

Name: Name of each cryptocurrency. The Datetime Column was changed from object to dataetime data type.
